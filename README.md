Description:
NYC 311 Service Requests Analysis by Python Data set Link- https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Data-Science-with-Python-Project-2-

Background of Problem Statement:
NYC 311's mission is to provide the public with quick and easy access to all New York City government services and information while offering the best customer service. Each day, NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars. These requests are received by NYC311 and forwarded to the relevant agencies such as the police, buildings, or transportation. The agency responds to the request, addresses it, and then closes it.

Goals:
For this analysis we want to answer a few questions while working with the data:
1. How many types of complaints that occur?
2. Complaints by neighborhood in NYC?
3. What are the top complaints?
4. What are the ticket status of the complaints?

Files:
A single jupyter notebook is used in this project utilizing python, with comments for to explain each step of the analysis.
